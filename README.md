This project explores the physicochemical properties affecting the quality of red wine using the UCI Wine Quality Dataset.

## Project Highlights
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on features like acidity, alcohol, sulphates, pH, etc.
- Identified key variables impacting wine quality
- Created visualizations using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`
- Correlation heatmaps, violin plots, histograms included

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
